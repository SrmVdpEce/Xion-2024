      </p>
      <p class="innercont-p">
        6. There can be several bridges of the different materials. The angle of inclination can
be up to 45 degrees.

      </p>
      <p class="innercont-p">
        7. The shortcuts can be placed anywhere in the circuit which will be reducing the
normal track length.

      </p>
      <p class="innercont-p">
        8. The race track will be a dirt track with turns, bends, pits, S-shaped curves and
        bumps.
        
      </p>
      <p class="innercont-p">
        9. A lap is deemed to be completed when the machine completes the entire track & comes back to the starting point.


      </p>
      <p class="innercont-p">
        10. The track may have a muddy terrain and bumps of not more than 0.5 meter radius.

      </p>
      <p class="innercont-p">
        11. The track may also have trenches of depth not more than 0.15 meter.

        SPECIFICATIONS OF MACHINE:

      </p>
      <p class="innercont-p">
        a. Maximum Dimensions of machine during the entire course of the race:
600 mm x 400 mm x 400 mm (Length x Width x Height).

      </p>
      <p class="innercont-p">
        b. Some parts such as gears, differential gear, engine, springs, shock absorbers,
servo motors, batteries, wheels and wheel hub; these parts can be purchased
and used directly.

      </p>
      <p class="innercont-p">
        c. Chassis has to be fabricated by the team itself. Use of any Lego parts and
assembly kits for chassis is not allowed and may lead to disqualification. If the
parts are not fabricated, penalty shall be applied to the team.

      </p>
      <p class="innercont-p">
        d. Use of clutch, brake and suspension mechanisms is advised for better
functioning and will carry extra bonus points. However, it is not necessary to
incorporate them.

      </p>
      <p class="innercont-p">
        e. There must be an on-board power supply for any electrically operated
mechanisms. The power supply should not exceed 12 volts at any time.

      </p>
      <p class="innercont-p">
        f. The vehicle has to be necessarily controlled by a wireless remote control
system throughout the competition. The vehicle must have two remote
control of different frequencies or an alternate frequency remote control
circuit which can be switched to either frequency before the start of the
game. This is done to avoid frequency interference between the two
competing vehicles. Remote control systems available in the market may also
be used.Both pistol type and stick type transmitters are allowed.
 

      </p>
      <p class="innercont-p">
        1st ROUND:
• It is a time trial round.
• Each team will be given two-three trials (depends upon time constraints) and the
best will be taken.
• 2 laps to be covered in each round will be notified along with track specification.
• If a car gets damaged in this round severely (i.e. not in a position to move further)
then the Time count for it will be up to the time taken by it to cover the last check
post.
• The team members will be questioned about their car by the coordinators before
